    <h1> Adam Pearson Portfolio </h1>
    <p> I am dedicated, ambitious and creative; I always try my hardest in what I do.
        At the moment, I am currently studying at CodeNation on the 12 week Master course, I am towards the end of the course. It is a huge commitment as I have had to move into my Auntie’s house, which is in Wilmslow; I live in a little village called Church Fenton, which is between Leeds and York. 
        On the course I have so far learnt and am continuing to develop my knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
        Currently I am focusing on backend development, using MySQL and node. 
        I went into this course with no prior knowledge in coding or languages, I had been wanting to learn coding for about 8 months before I joined CodeNation; I applied for a lot of apprenticeships before CodeNation but I heard nothing back, which prompted me to discover this course and develop sought after skills . 
        My aim for by the time I have completed this course is to be able to comfortably make my own webpage with a custom url. 
        I have become very confident in CSS as I have been using it a lot for my portfolio and other projects, such as my runway animation.   </p>
    
        <h2> Hobbies and Interests </h2>
        <p2> 
            I play CSGO at a very high level, I have been in a few amateur/Semi-Professional teams but due to work commitments, I have never been able to fully advance to the level I would hope to be. 
            
            I enjoy BMXing and often visit skateparks throughout summer with my friends. 
            
            A more recent hobby that I have decided to take up is Go Karting, I have visited several different tracks and have improved a lot since when I first began, despite the short time frame. I am very competitive when partaking in sports, which causes for me to be very determined and motivated - much alike to my determination and motivation to become a software developer.
            
            I used to love golf, where I played for York first team, Garforth and Scarthingwell and played off a 6 handicap but got a long term injury when I was 16 and haven’t been able to play since, it’s been just over 3 years now.
