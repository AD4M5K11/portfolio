<div class = "about-me"> <h1> Adam Pearson, Portfolio </h1> <p> I am dedicated, ambitious and creative; I always try my hardest in what I do.
    At the moment, I am currently studying at CodeNation on the 12 week Master course, I am towards the end of the course. It is a huge commitment as I have had to move into my Auntieâ€™s house, which is in Wilmslow; I live in a little village called Church Fenton, which is between Leeds and York. 
    On the course I have so far learnt and am continuing to develop my knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
    Currently I am focusing on backend development, using MySQL and node. 
    I went into this course with no prior knowledge in coding or languages, I had been wanting to learn coding for about 8 months before I joined CodeNation; I applied for a lot of apprenticeships before CodeNation but I heard nothing back, which prompted me to discover this course and develop sought after skills . 
    My aim for by the time I have completed this course is to be able to comfortably make my own webpage with a custom url. 
    I have become very confident in CSS as I have been using it a lot for my portfolio and other projects, such as my runway animation. </p> </div>
