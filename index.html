<h1> Adam Pearson Portfolio </h1>
    <p> I am a very determined and dedicated person. I went from a 54 handicap to a 6 handicap in 5 years when I played golf, this was even through my growth spurts which seriously impacted my ability to play at the ages of 13/14, as a result of my loss of form through growing I was removed from the Yorkshire development squad, this was heartbreaking but I knew that if I stuck to it, practiced as much as possible and dedicated every spare minute I had to playing golf I would be able to become a Yorkshire player once again, just before I was diagnosed with my injury in 2016 my coach and I were planning on arranging to join the Yorkshire squad again. But I took the positive out of the whole situation as my 3 years of hard work was about to pay off.  </p>

    <a> I am very ambitious and motivated, I would always set targets before a competition and even if people told me I wouldn't hit them I would try even harder just to prove them wrong and prove to myself that I am a better player than I was the week before. I would also always set up imaginary scenarios when I was practicing just so that I felt pressure and always had to try my best. </a>    

    <d> I see myself as a very creative person and I usually think outside the box, whilst being logical. In golf I used to always baffle my oponents in matches by using strategies that they could not understand why I did them or how they worked, I got lots of feedback off coaches to cherish this way of thinking as it is what used to seperate me from my oponents. I also play as In Game Leader and Strategist in A game called CSGO, I am around the Semi-Professional level of this game and I use my creative mind to think of strategies in game that will win us the round or make the oponents next round harder. </d>  

 
    <e> I have come to codenation with no prior coding experience and not a lot of knowledge about coding at all. I just knew from the second that I heard about software development that I would love it as a job and a hobby. I love the idea of a job that constantly stimulates my brain and one that I can always improve on. Before the course I was constantly applying for software development apprenticeships in and around Leeds but I heard nothing back from any company in the 8 months I spent applying, this made my drive to learn coding exponentially increase. I found Codenation at the end of December and started on the 14th of January, I knew it was the best thing for me and I am enjoying it more than anything else. </e>  

    <c> I used to play Golf for York Union U18's first team, also my two clubs which were Garforth and Scarthingwell, I played off a 6 handicap but when I turned 16 I got an injury and haven't been able to play golf since, even after two years of physiotherapy. </c>
    
        
        <h3> Hobbies and Interests </h3>
        
        <p2>    I play CSGO at a very high level, I have been in a few amateur/Semi-Professional teams but due to work commitments, I have never been able to fully advance to the level I would hope to be. 
            
            I enjoy BMXing and often visit skateparks throughout summer with my friends. 
            
            A more recent hobby that I have decided to take up is Go Karting, I have visited several different tracks and have improved a lot since when I first began, despite the short time frame. I am very competitive when partaking in sports, which causes for me to be very determined and motivated - much alike to my determination and motivation to become a software developer.
            
            I used to love golf, where I played for York first team, Garforth and Scarthingwell and played off a 6 handicap but got a long term injury when I was 16 and haven’t been able to play since, it’s been just over 3 years now.
