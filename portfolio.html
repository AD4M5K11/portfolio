    <button class = "aboutme" onclick="about-me"> About Me </button>
    <p class = "about-me" > My name is Adam Pearson, I'm 19 years of age, I am an ambitious, dedicated and very positive person. I joined Codenation to learn how to code as I had a strong interest in coding but had no knowledge on how to get better, I live between Leeds and York so it was a large commitment as I have had to move into my Auntie's house in Wilmslow for three months. 
    I absolutely love Cars, BMXing and Golf, I am always playing about with my car and trying to make it better, I love the social aspect of cars as there are a lot of car meets through summer and I meet a lot of interesting and nice people who work on their cars and sometimes take you out for a drive in them, it's nice as my car is so much worse.
    I frequently go BMXing and do it a lot over Summer, I love the adrenaline aspect of it and the social side to it as you meet lots of people and can organise days to go down to the skate parks. 
    I used to play golf for York union first team, both of my clubs (Garforth and Scarthingwell) until I got injured two years ago when I was sixteen and told I could not play to the same standard for about six years. I am trying to get into it again now though as I love playing and meeting all the new people I played with on weekends in competitions. </p>
